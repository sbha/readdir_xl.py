Python's `Pandas` can quickly and easily aggregrate data from multiple sheets from multiple Excel workbooks into a single data frame. A custom function combining functions from the `Pandas` package provides a template that can be adapted and expanded to handle many different data specific needs. 

This exercise is also done using [R's Tidyverse](https://github.com/sbha/readdir_xl).
